               (Filipino: <i>Bahurang Tubbataha</i>), is a protected area of the Philippines located 
               in the middle of the Sulu Sea. The marine and bird sanctuary consists of two 
               huge atolls (<i>named the North Atoll and South Atoll</i>) and the smaller Jessie 
               Beazley Reef covering a total area of <b>97,030 hectares</b> (239,800 acres; 374.6 sq mi). 
               It is located <b>150 kilometres</b> (93 mi) southeast of Puerto Princesa, the capital of
               Palawan.[2] The uninhabited islands and reefs are part of the island municipality 
               of Cagayancillo, located roughly <b>130 kilometers</b> (81 mi) to the northeast of the reef.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Busuanga is the largest island in the Calamian Group of islands located within
               the Palawan province of the Philippines. Many visitors are drawn to the island 
               for aquatic adventures thanks to thriving coral reefs and rich World War II history. 
               Fun fact: the Busuanga coastline is the permanent resting place of twelve World War II 
               Japanese wrecks that were sunk by the American navy in the 1940s.</p>

            <p>Panglao island is located southwest of the island of Bohol and east and 
                south of Cebu. Panglao has a terrain that ranges from plain, hilly to 
                mountainous. Panglao is made of Maribojoc limestone, the youngest of the 
                limestone units found in the western area of Bohol.</p>

            <p>It is of historical significance in that it was the place where the Spaniards 
                went after an unfortunate experience in Cebu. It is said that the Spanish 
                explorers who came to this island in <b>1803</b> named it Panglao after the world 
                <i>'mapanglao'</i>, meaning <i>'lonesome place'</i>. It is also one of the oldest towns of Bohol.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Sagada is a quiet little mountain town in the Philippines where you can be adventurous, 
                contemplative and romantic. It’s a destination worth the trip.</p>

            <p>Tucked in the Cordillera Mountains and almost always shrouded in mist and 
                fog, Sagada in Mountain Province is a tiny, peaceful town famous for retaining 
                much of its indigenous culture. Located about 5,000 feet above sea level, Sagada 
                is famous for its cooler climate compared to most parts of the Philippines.</p>

                <br>
            
            <p>In a country made famous for its stunning beaches (such as Boracay and El Nido), 
                off-the-beaten path destinations usually take a backseat. One such gem can be 
                found in the Philippines, which has more than 7,100 islands.</p>

            <p>Nestled in the Cordillera Mountains, a mountain range on the Philippines’ largest 
                island, lies a town called Sagada, where quiet isn’t fabricated, where warm 
                pertains to the people (not the weather), and where yogurt tastes of heaven.</p>
