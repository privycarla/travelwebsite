       <p>The Cagsawa Ruins (also spelled as Kagsawa, historically spelled as Cagsaua) are the remnants of a 16th-century Franciscan church, the Cagsawa church. It was originally built in the town of Cagsawa in 1587 but was burned down and destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1636. It was rebuilt in 1724 by Fr. Francisco Blanco but was destroyed again, along with the town of Cagsawa, on February 1, 1814, during the eruption of Mayon Volcano.</p>

       <p>The baroque church of Cagsawa was originally built in 1587 in the small town of Cagsawa (spelled as Cagsaua during the Hispanic era in the Philippines). 
          The church, however, was burned down by Dutch pirates on July 25, 1636. In 1724, the church was rebuilt by Franciscan friars under Father Francisco Blanco.
          The ruins of the Cagsawa church now stands as the site of the Cagsawa Ruins Park, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Albay. 
          It is also the site of the Cagsawa Branch of the National Museum of the Philippines, also known as the Cagsawa National Museum. 
          The museum was established on land that was donated by the municipality of Daraga to the National Museum on January 26, 1981.</p>

        <p>Cagsawa Festival spans for a month. Its calendar of activities starts on February 1, a day marked with commemoration of the 1814 eruption through a celebration of the Holy Eucharist and an opening ceremony. 
           Prayers are offered to those who perished from the disaster.
           Other activities include parade, talent contests (dance, singing, music), beauty pageants such as the Search for Mutya & Ginoo ng Cagsawa, cultural presentations and programs, sports, concerts, culinary events, entertainment, competitions, and fairs.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Batad is a small village located in the Cordillera mountains of Northern Luzon in the Philippines. It is beautiful, remote, and historically significant, and getting there involves a hike through the mountains.
            The rice terraces are all the product of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has occupied the Philippine mountains for thousands of years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Where are the Rice Terraces in the Philippines</h2>
            <div class="thum">
                <img src="loc of rt.png" alt="">
            </div>      
        <p>The rice terraces are located in the remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago.</p>
        <h2>MORE RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
        <h3>HIKE THE MILLENNIA-OLD RICE TERRACES AT BATAD</h3>
        <p>The rice terraces of the Philippine Ifugao are a UNESCO World Heritage site that covers 10,360 square kilometers (about 4,000 square miles) of steep, mountainous terrain in maze-like hand-carved terraces, some of which are more than 2,000 years old. 
            The most spectacular of all the terraces are located in Batad, about a 2-hour drive and 1-hour hike from the nearest town, Banaue. The trek is worth it, though, to see these majestic mountainsides carved into steppes and farmed using the same traditional methods that have been used for millennia.</p>
        <h3>MEET RITA, ONE OF THE LAST TRADITIONAL IFUGAO WEAVERS</h3>
        <p>The village of Batad is about a 2-hour drive and 1-hour hike from the town of Banaue in the province of Ifugao, on northern Luzon in the Philippines. Batad is an ancient village, home to some of the area’s oldest (by that I mean 2000 years old) rice terraces. The village has changed little over the past two millennia, although tourism and development are slowly creeping in. There is a small guesthouse and restaurant with a balcony overlooking the rice terraces called Rita’s. Rita is a kind old woman, about 70 by her best estimate, but they didn’t keep track of age when she was born, so she’s not sure. She is one of the last two living practitioners of the traditional local weaving process. Rita can take plants from the jungle, separate their leaves into fibres to create thread, and then weave the thread into clothes, all by hand. She is a living piece of history and, if you find yourself in Batad, you must not miss the chance to meet her.
        </p>
        <h3>SLEEP IN AUTHENTIC NATIVE HUT ABOVE THE RICE TERRACES</h3>
        <p>Nestled in the hills above the Hapao Rice Terraces on northern Luzon in the Philippines is a resort called the Native Village Inn. The resort is built on a hillside with a majestic view looking up a valley of vibrant green rice terraces. The rooms are traditional native thatched-roofed huts built in the traditional style. It’s a unique and beautiful way to experience one of the Philippines greatest man-made treasures.
        </p>
        <h3>RICE TERRACES, HANGING COFFINS, BATAD etc.</h3>
        <p>Beautiful area! From Banaue you can explore Hapao, Sagada and Batad easy and cheap. You arrange for a driver to take you around (there are plenty of drivers in Banaue). In Hapao you will find beautiful rice terraces. In Sagada you have the interesting hanging coffins and caves. Batad is a very primitive town that has no road access, expect alot of hiking. The town is in the middle of a rice terrace that has the shape of an ampfitheater. This is not an easy hike, pic is from this hike. But well worth it to walk through this town.
        </p>
        <h3>HIKING</h3>
        <p>Hiking among rice fields is one of the highligts in central Luzon. If you have time, you don’t really need a guide. You could rent a bike or take public transport among biger villages, Going from Sagada to Banaue - the road is much better than it used to be so instead of jeepneys you coud take more comfortable option for the same price – a van.

        <h1>MINOR BASILICA OF THE HOLY CHILD OF CEBU( BASILICA DEL STO. NINO)</h1>
            <br>

            <br>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Minor Basilica of the Holy Child, locally known as the Basílica Minore del Santo Niño de Cebú and commonly known as Santo Niño Basilica, is a minor basilica in Cebu City in the Philippines that was founded in 1565 by Fray Andrés de Urdaneta and Fray Diego de Herrera. It is the oldest Roman Catholic church in the country, allegedly built on the spot where the image of the Santo Niño de Cebú was found during the expedition of Miguel López de Legazpi.
            The church of the Holy Child was founded by Fray Andrés de Urdaneta, O.S.A. on April 28, 1565, the day when the image of the Holy Child was found in a partially burned hut. More than a week passed after the rediscovery of the image on May 8, 1565, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi initiated the founding of the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines. On the spot of the house where the image of the Santo Niño was found, the monastery of the Holy Name of Jesus was constructed.</p><br>

        <h2>Present church</h2>
        <p>In February 1735, Father Provincial Bergaño, Governor-General Fernando Valdes, Bishop Manuel Antonio Decio y Ocampo of Cebu and Fray Juan de Albarran, O.S.A. started the foundations of the present church, using stone. Since the friars did not have the means to complete the church, they enlisted the help of the parishioners of Opon and San Nicolas to contribute materials, while the people of Talisay contributed labor.</p><br>
        <h2>2013 earthquake and restoration</h2>
        <p>On October 15, 2013, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake shook Tagbilaran, Bohol; its force felt throughout the Visayas. It caused more than 220 casualties, and damages to buildings, particularly historical landmarks and churches in Bohol. In Cebu City, the earthquake destroyed most of the Basilica's belfry and façade; some walls and frescoes were cracked.<br>
            the restoration of the basilica was one of the 16 projects facilitated by National Historical Commission of the Philippines in Cebu province in 2015.<br>
        <h2>Heritage designations</h2>
        <p>The Church and Convent of Santo Niño was declared a National Historical Landmark in 1941.[11] In 1965, Pope Paul VI declared the basilica to be "the symbol of the birth and growth of Christianity in the Philippines."In his pontificate, the ecclesiastical document Ut Clarificetur designated the basilica as the "Mother and Head of all Churches in the Philippines" (Mater et Caput... Omnium Ecclesiarum Insularum Philippinarum).
        <h2>Pilgrim Center</h2>
            <br>
                <div class="thum">

                </div>
            <br>
        <p>The devotees kept increasing over the years and could easily fill the Basilica. To accommodate this growing number of devotees who come to hear mass in the Basilica, a pilgrim center was built within the church compound opposite of the Basilica.</p>
        <h2>Museum</h2>
            <br>
                <div class="thum">
                    <img src="museu.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
            <br>    
        <p>The museum was first established in the year 1965 by Rev. Fr. Ambrosio J. Galindez, O.S.A., mainly for the purpose of commemoration of the fourth Centennial Celebration of the Christianization of the Philippines. It was located at the Basilica Minore del Sto. Niño de Cebu Convent. Vestments and assorted offerings to Santo Niño were displayed in a certain room at the convent.</p><br>
        <h2>Basilica del Santo Niño Library</h2>

                </div>
            <br>
        <p>The library, for centuries, was for the exclusive use of the Friars. But, in the year 2000, it was opened to researchers so that it can be of service to them. Since then, the library has accommodated a lot of researchers doing specific studies on the image of Santo Niño de Cebu, the church (Basilica), the convent and the Augustinians in the Philippines and in the world. However, the collection of books of the library is not only confined to these, but it also has books in various disciplines like, history and geography, religion, theology, philosophy, social sciences, languages, arts and literature. </p> <br>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>The Basílica Minore del Santo Niño de Cebu Basilica Complex is located in a city block bordered by Osmeña Boulevard, D. Jakosalem St, P. Burgos St. and the Plaza Sugbo where the Magellan's Cross is located. The main entrance is on Osmeña Boulevard. Two blocks north of the basilica is the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cebu.</p>

            <p><b>The Ruins</b> <i>is the remains of the ancestral home mansion of the family of Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson and Maria Braga Lacson. It is situated in Talisay, Negros Occidental, Philippines. The mansion was built in early 1900s and inspired by Italian architecture.</i></p><br>
            <p>The Ruins Mansion is the remains of an ancestral home built in 1920 by a wealthy sugar baron named Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson. Don Mariano constructed the mansion as a testament of his love for his Portuguese wife, Cora Maria Osorio Rosa-Braga, after she passed away in 1911. Maria, who was pregnant with their eleventh child at the time, lost her and their baby’s lives after figuring in an accident. 
               Don Mariano built the structure in a 440-hectare sugar plantation situated in the border of present-day Talisay and Bacolod. Its architecture was described as Italianate due to deriving inspiration from Italian Architecture. However, it was later set aflame in 1942 by Filipino guerilla fighters employed by the United States Armed Forces during the Second World War. 
               This was done in order to prevent its use as a military office by the Invading Japanese Forces. It continuously burned for three days until only its current cement frame was left standing. The original intention was to burn it to the ground. Despite losing the majority of the mansion, its ruins have been recognized as one of the architectural wonders of the Philippines. It has also gained titles such as  the “Taj Majal of the Philippines.” 
               Today, the Ruins Mansion is in the private ownership of the great-grandchildren of Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson and Cora Maria Osorio Rosa-Braga. </p><br>

        <h2>History and Bid for UNESCO Heritage List</h2>
        <p>Calle Crisologo owes its name to the illustrious Ilocano poet, writer, and playwright Governor Marcelino 
            “Mena” Crisologo. Previously, the street was called Calle de Escolta de Vigan, whose residents were mostly
            families who profited from the galleon trade that included Ilocos as a key port. When Governor Crisologo 
            died in 1927, the street was renamed Calle Crisologo in his honor.
            The street is part of Vigan’s picturesque Heritage Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This consists of 
            about 200 beautifully restored houses dating back to the 16th century. The buildings on Crisologo particularly 
            display a blend of indigenous Filipino and colonial European construction. 
            It took 10 years for Vigan to be named a World Heritage Site since it was submitted for consideration in 
            1989. The town was initially rejected for inclusion reportedly because it could not compare with Spanish-Colonial 
            cities such as Cartagena in Colombia and Trinidad in Cuba.
            Local advocates campaigned that Vigan’s architectures more similarly reflect those of old Asian trading cities like 
            Hoi An, Malacca, or Macau. In fact, many houses in Calle Crisologo were owned not only by scions of Spanish 
            settlers but also by wealthy Chinese who migrated to Ilocos Sur to set up businesses. </p>
        <br>

        <h2>How to Get There</h2>
        <p> To visit the historic and picturesque Calle Crisologo, one must reach Vigan City first. The best jumpoff point 
            would be the capital of the Philippines, Manila, as many transportation options are available from here to Vigan,
            both by air and by land. 
            Traveling by bus from Manila to Vigan will be the cheapest option, although expect to spend around 8 to 10 hours 
            on the road. Many bus lines offer the direct Vigan route, with premium ones such as Partas Bus in Cubao and 
            Farinas Transit in Pasay that feature WiFi, TV, and toilets; and regular bus companies such as Dominion Bus, 
            Aniceto Bus, and Viron Transit at relatively lower fares. Some buses like Philippine Rabbit Bus Line, Florida, 
            Maria de Leon, Baliwag, and RCJ Transit pass by Vigan as well, on their way to Laoag City. It is recommended 
            to take overnight trips so you can just sleep through the long ride and don’t save on accommodation expenses 
            for one night.
            
            Those coming from the Clark International Airport in Pampanga may ride a shuttle service or jeepney to Dau Integrated 
            Bus Terminal where buses going to Vigan and Laoag await. If you are coming from Baguio, there are buses bound for Laoag 
            that stop at Vigan. From Abra or Tuguegarao, buses from these places also stop in Vigan.
            If you want to save time, take a flight from Manila to Laoag, which takes only an hour, and go on a 2-hour bus trip to Vigan. 
            Once you are in Vigan City, Calle Crisologo is just 500m away from the bus terminal, so you can take a quick tricycle ride or get there comfortably on foot.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>The best time to visit Calle Crisologo and other attractions in Vigan City is during the dry season from December to May, 
            as many of these sights are best explored by walking around. If you wish to avoid the chances of rain and the intense summer heat, 
            you can also visit the dry yet colder months of December until February.
            
            January sees Vigan celebrating different festivals, so this is also a great time to immerse yourself in the town’s culture other 
            than its wonderful sights and landmarks. Vigan is known for its longganisa, a local sausage known for its garlicky flavor, and the town 
            celebrates the Longganisa Festival every January 22. 
            
            Just a few days after, on January 25, the town celebrates its Vigan Town Fiesta in honor of St. Paul the Apostle, with festive exhibits and
            cultural performances that last for an entire week. Calle Crisologo, already vibrant on normal days, becomes more alive during May as the Viva Vigan Festival of Arts happens in the 
            first week of this month, celebrating the rich history and culture of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
