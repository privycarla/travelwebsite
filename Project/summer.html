      <h1>Let’s Talk About Batanes: A Traveller’s Dream</h1>
      <br>
      <p><i>“The only trip you will ever regret is the one you don’t take.”</i></p>
      <p>Batanes. My dream destination. A destination which remained elusive until recently. I have been procrastinating for so long. It was a case of should I go now, or wait till next month? Will the weather be good? What if the weather gets bad when I am there and I get stranded? This was one trip with a lot ifs and buts. But then finally, I threw all cautions up in there air and opted to follow my gut feeling.</p>
      <p>Batanes is the northernmost part of the Philippines. The smallest province, a part of which is nearer to Taiwan than Luzon. I am pretty sure that most if not all Filipino travelers include Batanes in their bucket list.</p>
      <p>My first memories of Batanes came from textbooks during grade school. Pictures of stone houses, the Ivatan people with their local head gear, and the rolling hills with wild horses grazing on never ending green pasture lands, really appealed to me. But going there is not easy and can be expensive. The unpredictable weather and prohibitive costs of plane fare are the reasons why travellers and tourists seldom visit the so-called paradise of the north.</p>
      <p>As the Bombardier Q400 of Philippine Airlines left Manila and flew over mainland Luzon, I was amazed with the view from my window seat. I have never gone this far north of Manila. Unlike the scattered islands in the Visayas, the view consisted of large chunks of islands where you can see white outlines around it caused by the crashing waves. The trip from Manila to Basco lasted for an hour and a half. While the plane was manuevering, I can already see the landscapes of Batanes. A lighthouse stood by a cliff. The rolling hills were greeting me from the horizon. It was indeed breath-taking. I was saying to myself – Wow! I am finally here! F I N A L L Y !</p>
      <p>Upon arrival, you will need to register at the tourism office and pay a fee of P300. I booked in advance, a fan room with Marfel’s Lodge for 4 nights amounting to P2,000. I also booked with BISUMI Travel and Tours for P4,999, which consisted of the Batan North Tour, Batan South Tour and Sabtang Tour. Both representatives from Marfel and Bisumi were at the airport to meet me and brought me to the lodge to rest up to 12 noon. After which the tour began.</p>

      <p>Believe me when I say that these photos does not do justice to the actual beauty of Batanes. You have to go and see Batanes for your self.</p>

         <h1>Some Reasons To Make Boracay Island Your Next Vacation Destination</h1>
           <br>
           <p><i>“ Boracay is the kind of island you will never want to leave. I’ve traveled to more than 50 countries and there are not many places where I’ve returned 5 times. Boracay is one of them ” <br><i><b>- Sabrina Lovina (travel blogger)</b></i></i></p>
           <p><b>Welcome to paradise.</b> Boracay is a tiny tropical island where people from all over the world come to enjoy beach life, watersport activities, and a vibrant nightlife. It’s located in the mid-west of the <b>Philippines</b> – a one hour flight away from the country’s capital (<b>Manila</b>).
            Boracay’s attraction isn’t limited to just a few things. It’s the combination of many things that makes this island unique.</b></p>

            <p>So without further talk, <b>take a look over my shoulder as I show you Boracay.</b></p>
            <h3>1. Its Stunning White Beach</h3>
                <div class="thum">
                  <img src="wb.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><b>White Beach</b> is the main beach of Boracay. It’s 4 kilometers long and has resorts, restaurants and nightlife venues along it.</p>
                <p>The main reasons why people love this beach are: <br>
                  - Beautiful <b>shallow and still</b> turquoise water – great for swimming <br>
                  - <b>Amazing views</b> while you eat & drink right in front of the beach <br>
                  - <b>Powdery</b> white sand that never gets hot br
                  - A beautiful sandy beach path, <b>with shade</b>
                </p>

           <h3>2. Eight More Beautiful Beaches</h3>
               <div class="thum">
                 <img src="map.png" alt="">
               </div>
           <br>
               <p><b>Boracay Island</b> has not 1, 2 or 3 beautiful beaches but 9, and all within close proximity of each other since the <br> island is very small (7 by 1.5 kilometers).</p>
               <p>Each beach also has its own attractiveness. Some are amazingly beautiful, some are good for snorkeling, some have privacy, and some have a mix of those and other things.</p>

           <h3>3. The Friendly Local People</h3>
               <div class="thum">
                 <img src="lf.jpg" alt="">
               </div>
          <br>
               <p>When you arrive in Boracay one of the first things you’ll notice is the friendliness and openness of the local <br> people. That’s not where it stops though…</p>
               <p>Filipinos also speak English as their second language, so there is no language barrier (unlike as in so many other <br>South East Asian countries). Because of this you can easily connect and make friends with locals as well as with <br>other tourists.</p>

          <h3>4. The Vibrant Nightlife</h3>
              <div class="thum">
                 <img src="nl.png" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>Meeting new people or just having a fun night out with your friends is easy with many nightlife venues to choose <br>from. Plus alcohol is cheap so if you like to drink you’re in the right place.</p>

        <h1>Baguio City: A Dream Place to Live</h1>
        <!-- baguio info -->
        <br>
        <p>Imagine yourself standing in front of a window. As you closed your eyes the 
            wind started to caress your face with its gentle touch and with its cool breeze 
            refreshing your soul. The humming birds replace the loud noise in your 
            mind, calming all your senses, making you feel relaxed in the world full of 
            stress and pressure. Then slowly, open your eyes look at those beautiful 
            flowers in the field and then shift your gaze to those green robust trees 
            around. If you don’t see what I described and longed to experience all I
            mentioned above, then Baguio City Philippines is the best place for you to live in.</p>

        <p>Baguio City is the best place to live at, and there are a lot of facts to prove 
            this. First, there are a lot of beautiful places in Baguio City. It is undeniable 
            that Baguio has a colourful glow that no other cities can equal. The rich 
            culture of the City has a great contribution to its glow and that is the reason 
            why a lot of artists considered to make Baguio as their home.</p>
        
            <div class="thum">
                <img src="b.png" alt="">
            </div>

        <p>Second, creativity overflows all over the place. If you love music, arts, 
            literature, and other things that are fuelled by creativity, then Baguio City is 
            the best place for you. The serenity of the place can stimulate the mind to 
            think deeper and it encourages the mind to look wider with a greater and 
            clearer perspective to the world. The breath-taking beauty of nature will 
            capture you and swallow you which will leave you stunned with the encounter of 
            the greatness of the Almighty. The quietness of the place will surely sanctify
            your ears and with the soft whisper of the wind you will be able to hear yourself 
            more than the screaming nonsense of the world.</p>
            
            <div class="thum">
                <img src="bg2.png" alt="">
            </div>
        
        <p>Another reason to choose Baguio City is that of its market place. Shopping 
           is one of the most awesome things you can do in this city. There are lots 
           of quality products to choose from and it comes from different varieties. You
           can also find interestingly unique local products available in the market and
           tasty delicacies that will surely satisfy your eyes and your craving and won’t
           leave your budget hanging.</p>

           <div class="thum">
               <img src="bg3.png" alt="">
           </div>
        
        <p>The city itself is located and surrounded by mountains, but it is a well-developed 
           city with a lot of commercial establishments in it. You won’t be bored because there’s 
           a lot of places you can hop at and hop again with your friends and families. It is also
           worth considering that, the city has the best academic institutions that provide high 
           standard education for your family. And if you’re still not convinced that Baguio is not
           the place for you, well you should be knowing this. Every year the property value in Baguio
           City goes up and that is another reason for you to consider owning a property there.</p>

           <div class="thum">
               <img src="bg4.png" alt="">
           </div>
        
        <p>With everything I have mentioned above about Baguio City, I can say that it is really a great
           place. And it’s not only because of its temperature but there’s more than that. Baguio is great 
           because it embraces everyone with its hospitality whether you are a local, a tourist, or the most 
           diverse person in the world. The citizens will always greet you with those warm welcoming smiles 
           and I believe that it is the greatest reason for you to consider Baguio as a place to call Home.</p>
