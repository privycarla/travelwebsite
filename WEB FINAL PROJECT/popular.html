    <h2>TRAVEL DIARIES</h2>
    <h3><i>The best thing to do and see - March 10, 2023</i></h3>
    <p><b>Bohol</b> is a province of the Philippines, in the country’s Central Visayas region. It is where we can find the beautiful place named Bohol Island and numerous smaller surrounding islands. It is known for coral reefs and unusual geological formations, notably the Chocolate Hills.</p>
    <h2>Why Bohol?</h2>
    <p>Bohol has a mixture of everything that makes the Philippines so special. It is easy to get to and is safe, fun and friendly. If it is your first time in the Philippines then Bohol is one of the best islands to start with. It is a relatively big island and you can actually spend a long time exploring.</p>

    <h2>Getting There?</h2>
    <p><i>"We took the fast ferry from Cebu to Bohol and it cost us 800-1000 Pesos each. The journey is roughly 2 hours. Each time we crossed the weather was calm and the water fairly flat. There are also the options to fly if you are coming from manila or Cebu itself if you would rather fly. Arrive with plenty of time at the ferry port though as the lines can be long and you might miss your boat."</i></p>
    <h2>Folklore and Stories</h2>
    <p>We, Filipinos are very fond of folklore, so there are few mythical origins as to how the hills came to be like about fairies, diety and mythical stories. According to one story, a giant who had been crestfallen in love wept, and the hills grew where his tears fell. In another version, a pair of giants went to war and lobbed boulders at each other for days. The giants eventually resolved their differences, but the mounds remained where the rocks landed.</p>

    <p>The Philippine island of Bohol is the definition of an island paradise. Situated southwest of the country's capital, Manila, Bohol is the 10th largest island in the country, lying in the middle of the Visayas. Surrounded by other islands on all sides, Bohol is shielded from the region's frequent typhoons as well as from the heavy rains during the monsoon season. Bohol has an abundance of activities and sights for visitors, so many that tourists often have a hard time choosing what to do first. The island's hospitable inhabitants might be the biggest draw, and one can't help but feel at home in the island's lush greenery and countless resorts.</p>
    <h2>Where to Stay?</h2>
    <p>Regardless of the hotel, watching the sunset on the horizon of <b><i>Alona Beach</i></b> is worth stay by itself.</p>
    <p>For something more luxurious, check out <b><i>The Peacock Garden</i></b>, a 40-room boutique resort with an expansive view of the sea. It's a 15-minute drive from Tagbilaran City, the island's capital. To complement the rooms, the resort also features a fine dining restaurant, spa, wine cellar, music and dance club, as well as business facilities.</p>

    <p>The Majestic MAYON VOLCANO: Albay, Philippines</p>
  </div>
    <article>
      <h2>TRAVEL DIARIES</h2>
      <h3><i>The best experience in Albay- April 12, 2023</i></h3>
      <p><i>“Mayon is the most beautiful mountain I have ever seen, the world-renowned Fujiyama (Mt. Fuji) of Japan sinking into perfect insignificance by comparison.”</i> —British traveler-writer A. Henry Savage Landor</p>
      <p>Yay, I can’t find any other way of opening this blog entry than with that quote by A. Henry Savage Landor, a traveler-writer from the UK.</p>

      <p><i>"Since I was a kid, I had heard a lot of great things about the Mayon Volcano — active, most active, unstable, volatile, angry, beautiful, grand, great, perfect. I had never been this excited to see this restless terrain."</i></p>
      <p><b>Mayon Volcano, or Mount Mayon,</b> is well-known around the world as the <b><i>“perfect cone”</i></b> volcano, thanks to its almost symmetric conical shape — a unique feature. It is also the most active volcano in the Philippines, having erupted almost 50 times in the past 400 years alone. The site is also a protected landscape and a natural park.</p>
      <p>On our third day, we had to leave the Hunongan Cove early since we still needed to go to Albay and be overwhelmed by the beauty that was Mayon. After we packed our things we took our breakfast and left the cove at around 8:15AM. When we arrived in Legazpi, the imposing volcano was already attracting me. It was really overwhelming. It was perfect. And I’m not just talking about its shape. Aaah, I can’t describe it properly. It gave me goosebumps. It was a perfect sight to behold. Perfect perfect perfect.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>How to go to Mayon Volcano or Legazpi City?</h2>
      <p>A train ride to Legazpi City from Manila would be fun, but the government is still currently reviving the national railway that used to service these cities. Today, the only way to get to Legazpi City from Manila is by plane, bus, or by using your private vehicle.</p>
      <p><i>"Personally, I can’t wait for the Manila-Bicol railway route to resume operation. Besides being safer and more comfortable than a bus ride, it will be a totally new experience for me. I haven’t tried any railway service in our country other than LRT and MRT in Metro Manila."</i></p>
      <h2>By Plane</h2>
      <p>Are you short on time? Air travel would be your best option to arrive in Legazpi City.</p>
      <p>Typically, flights from Manila to Legazpi are available daily and should only last for an hour or less. Flights are usually cheap and cost only 10 to 15 dollars higher than a bus ride.</p>
      <p><b>TIP:</b><i>If you plan ahead of time, watch out for the local airline companies’ flight seat sales (Cebu Pacific, Air Asia, Philippine Airlines). These promos usually happen during the same day-month-digit dates. Example, 3-3 seat sale (March 3).</i></p>

      <h2>By Bus</h2>
      <p><i>"Like me, a bus ride would be a good option for travelers who love to travel slowly."</i></p>
      <p>You can choose between different types of buses depending on your budget. You can pick between (1) an air-conditioned bus which is the cheapest, (2) an upgraded version of the air-conditioned bus, which has a restroom, reclining seats, and larger legroom, and lastly, (3) a sleeper bus.</p>
      <p><b><i>Bicol Isarog</i></b> is the only bus company that offers sleeper buses to the Bicol Region (Manila to Legazpi).</p>
      <p>You can catch other buses going to Bicol at these terminals around Metro Manila: Araneta Center bus station, EDSA Cubao, LRT Buendia, EDSA Pasay, PITX in Paranaque, and Alabang.</p>
      <p>The bus ride from Manila to Legazpi takes about 5 hours.</p>

      <h2>Festivals To Watch While Visiting Mayon Volcano!</h2>
      <p>Hundreds of festivals and fiestas happen in the Philippines all year round. There are 19 festivals in the province of Albay alone. But here are the ones that really got my attention:</p>
      <h2>Magayon Festival</h2>
      <p><b>Magayon Festival</b> is a yearly, month-long, colorful & lively celebration to honor the bounty and beauty of the province of Albay. The festival is derived from the legend of Daragang Magayon, whose death gave birth to the majestic Mount Mayon.</p>
      <p><i>"At first, I could not believe it was a month-long celebration! That’s epic! In our town in Batangas, our celebration only lasts for two days. The festival gets more fantastic when you see the actual events. Activities during the Magayon Festival are endless! Visitors may see local product exhibitions, workshops, float parades, fireworks displays, concerts, and live bands."</i></p>
      <p>You may also watch drum and lyre competitions, sports tournaments, colorful dance competitions, dance recitals, jobs fairs, paragliding experiences, dog marathons, beauty pageants, bodybuilders competitions, and grand SantaCruzan!</p>
      <p>Magayon Festival occurs <b><i>every May</i></b>. That’s a perfect time to go and visit Mount Mayon!</p>

          <p>Travel Diaries: Viva Vigan!</p>
        </div>
          <article>
            <p><i>"I’ve always wanted to go to Vigan since I was 12. I went through a patriotic phase (I used to read lots of heroic stories about Gabriella Silang, Bonifacio, Rizal and other unsung Filipino heroes) when I was in my pre-teen years and adored Filipino history. Though I’m not hung up on that anymore, I still love all things vintage and old architectures."</i></p>
            <p>I am finally living my dream when Cebu Pacific had a seat sale via Clark airport, I jumped at the chance to visit Vigan. Then here comes Kareen, tempting me to go to Banaue, so that’s why I ended up dragging my red maleta across 5 destinations (a la That Thing Called Tadhana). Mind you, I switched to a red canvas duffel bag for the Banaue leg, I cannot imagine myself dragging my red maleta across the rice terraces. And some people can’t imagine I survived 9 days of backpacking across Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Baguio, Banaue and back to Baguio.</p>

          <article>
            <p>From Clark airport, we rode a van masquerading as taxi, to Dau Terminal (Mabalacat Bus Terminal). The upside about riding a bus from Dau to Vigan is that the bus leaves whenever another bus bound for the same destination arrives. We left around 8 am and arrived in Vigan around 4-ish in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>In Vigan, hotels and restaurants are required to design their establishments in Spanish colonial style like that of the heritage city. Most establishments, especially in Calle Crisologo, transform the lower floor into a commercialized area. The tenants probably use the second floor as stock area.</p>
            <p>After checking in at <b>Green R Hotel</b>, we hired a tricycle to tour us around the city. We head to Bantay watch tower and had dinner in <b>Cafe Leona in Calle Crisologo.</b> The most-photographed street in Vigan–Calle Crisologo–transforms into a romantic lane in the evening with all the lamp posts casting a muted glow over the pavements.</p>
            <p>The following morning, we visited Bantay bell tower again (to catch natural light for pictures) and climbed the rickety stairs. The view overlooks a Santorini-like white buildings at first glance but those were actually white-washed headstones. Cemeteries are almost everywhere in Vigan like 7 Eleven and Mini Stop. A good number of people must’ve died for our country during the Spanish/American/Japanese times.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <p>Next stop is <b>Arce Mansion</b> to wear period dresses. Unfortunately, the mansion was closed with no signs or whatsoever. The number I used to contact with cannot be reached. So, we ended up visiting the Crisologo Mansion to compensate for the change of plans.</p>
            <p>Arce Mansion – if you look closely, the ceiling has a floral design carving which is common in old houses in Vigan</p>

            <h2>Vigan Travel Tips</h2>
            <p>– Vigan is famous for their Heritage Village. The place can toured in one day, so I suggest you do more research for other touristy things to do. Since we’re traveling on a really tight schedule (yes, 9 days is still tight when you’ve got loads of places to visit), we ditched the usual tourist spots and focused on the important places to see.</p>
            <p>– Food trip! Try the Vigan empanada, bagnet, tinubong, Candon kalamay and longganisa.</p>
            <p>– If you are planning to go to Pagudpud next, do not buy the windmill souvenirs in Vigan, it is much cheaper in Bangui itself–right at the location of the windmills.</p>
            <p>– If you are traveling solo, or in tandem, it is advisable to do DIY tours. It is cheaper to negotiate with a tricycle driver to take you around the city.</p>
